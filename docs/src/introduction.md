# Everything About Felys

Felys is a dynamically strongly typed scripting language with a syntax similar to Rust. It provides minimal features to support data grouping with dynamic length, i.e., tuples and lists. The entire project is intended to be a toy language for demonstration purposes only. I have never considered turning this into a real product; instead, it serves as a tribute to [Elysia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUe2BDz6RO4) from Honkai Impact 3rd.

Feel to try Felys using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev).

## Topics

In short, there are three main topics that worth sharing:

- Design principle that covers all the considerations involved in designing Felys.
- Implementation of a [PEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)/[Packrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packrat_parser) parser along with a [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)-driven lexer.
- Neural network framework with automatic differentiation and dynamic computation graph.

Some of these are a bit academic, but I believe this book should be accessible to most EE/CS undergraduates beyond their first year.

> Most of these are not done yet. Writing takes time.
