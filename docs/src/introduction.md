# Everything About Felys

Felys is an interpreted programming language written in Rust that comes with a compiler and a runtime. Feel to try Felys using the online [playground](https://exec.felys.dev). Please note, however, the language after reconstruction is very unstable and missing some features, e.g., neutral network.

## Noticeboard

Unfortunately, most old contents are no longer applicable after the reconstruction because of the new compilation framework. Therefore, I removed them and will work on the new topics I want to discuess in the next a few months.
